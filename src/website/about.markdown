AI Forum New Zealand formed the Generative AI Working Group to explore and
share developments in this fast-moving field. This site is part of that
initiative and serves as a living record of how generative AI is being applied
across industries in Aotearoa.

Pages for each industry are generated automatically by an LLM agent. As the
agent finds new information, the content here will grow. If you would like to
contribute or see how the system works, visit the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/mingnz/livingwp).
