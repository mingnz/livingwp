Welcome to the **AI Forum NZ Generative AI Working Group** website. Our goal is to maintain a constantly up‑to‑date snapshot of the Generative AI landscape in Aotearoa New Zealand.

This site is generated automatically by an LLM agent that scans for the latest news and creates markdown content for each industry page.

Each industry in New Zealand will eventually have its own page under [Industries](./industries/). These pages are kept fresh by the agent as new developments emerge.

Because this is an experiment in "drinking our own champagne", everything here is open source and we welcome contributions. [View the project on GitHub](https://github.com/ElementX-AI/living-whitepaper).

Learn more about [how this works](./how-it-works).
