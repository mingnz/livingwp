This project uses generative AI to keep the content up to date. An LLM agent
regularly searches for the latest news and automatically creates or updates
markdown pages for each industry in Aotearoa. The goal is to maintain a living
record of the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.

Everything here is open source. If you have suggestions or would like to help,
visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mingnz/livingwp).
