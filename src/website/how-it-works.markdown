This project uses generative AI to keep the content up to date. An LLM agent regularly searches for the latest news and automatically creates or updates markdown pages for each industry in Aotearoa. The goal is to maintain a living record of the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.

Full transparency is ensured through the open-source nature of the project, allowing anyone to inspect the prompts, workflows, and code that power the system.
