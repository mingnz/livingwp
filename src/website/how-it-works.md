This site is powered by a custom LLM agent that performs the following steps:

1. Plans research tasks for each industry page.
2. Searches the web for relevant New Zealand news and sources.
3. Generates or updates the markdown content.
4. Publishes the updated site so visitors always see the latest information.

The source code is openly available. Feel free to suggest improvements or new industry pages via [GitHub](https://github.com/ElementX-AI/living-whitepaper).
