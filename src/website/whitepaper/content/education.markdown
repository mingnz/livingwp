# AI Adoption in Education in New Zealand: A Living Whitepaper

**Introduction**  
Artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot), is rapidly entering education worldwide. In New Zealand, this shift is highlighted by UNESCO dedicating the International Day of Education 2025 to AI ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=AI%20is%20making%20a%20significant,gain%20traction%20in%20early%202023)) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/01/boosting-new-zealands-education-standards-with-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=This%20year%2C%20UNESCO%20has%20dedicated,for%20education%20in%20New%20Zealand)). Early stories in NZ focused on *cheating* (students using AI for assignments), but the conversation has shifted to **how AI can be integrated** effectively in learning ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Early%20news%20stories%20on%20AI,find%20its%20place%20in%20education)). NZ education faces challenges (gaps in literacy, numeracy, engagement) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/01/boosting-new-zealands-education-standards-with-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=,NZ%E2%80%99s%20education)), and AI offers tools for personalized learning and support.  However, educators stress that AI must *augment* rather than replace teachers, with careful attention to ethics, accuracy, and human values ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/12/11/integrating-ai-and-academia.html#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20is%20a%20disruptive,is%20the%20purpose%20of%20the)) ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/12/11/integrating-ai-and-academia.html#:~:text=Certainly%2C%20the%20widely%20discussed%20concerns,is%20otherwise%20difficult%20to%20scale)). 

**Policy & Frameworks**  
To guide schools, the Ministry of Education (MOE) and NZQA issued AI guidance in 2023. Key points include:  
- **Verify and Protect**: Educators should *verify AI outputs*, avoid submitting personal data, and watch for cultural bias ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/#:~:text=,reading%20terms%20and%20conditions)). Schools must adapt privacy and tech-use policies for AI; Netsafe provides an AI-specific policy template to help ([www.education.govt.nz](https://www.education.govt.nz/school/digital-technology/generative-ai/#:~:text=Schools%20should%20be%20considering%20whether,some%20other%20really%20useful%20resources)).  
- **Academic Integrity**: All NCEA schools must include AI use in assessment-authenticity policies. Teachers should promote academic integrity and explicitly teach students to use AI responsibly ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/#:~:text=Schools%20who%20assess%20listed%20standards,are%20in%20ensuring%20academic%20integrity)) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20is%20best%20to%20adopt,Policy%20should%20include)).  
- **Professional Development**: Generative AI training is rapidly expanding. Short courses and resources (online guides, AI primers) are available to help teachers learn AI tools and critical literacy with them ([www.education.govt.nz](https://www.education.govt.nz/school/digital-technology/generative-ai/#:~:text=PLD%20providers%20and%20tertiary%20institutions,specific%20learning%20areas%20or%20approaches)) ([www.education.govt.nz](https://www.education.govt.nz/school/digital-technology/generative-ai/#:~:text=your%20%C4%81konga%20safe%20as%20you,with%20these%20exciting%20new%20tools)).  
- **Privacy and Compliance**: NZ’s Privacy Commissioner has issued expectations for using AI tools safely and compliantly in schools ([www.education.govt.nz](https://www.education.govt.nz/school/digital-technology/generative-ai/#:~:text=New%20Zealand%E2%80%99s%20Office%20of%20the,teachers%20should%20be%20mindful%20of)). The MOE’s *Security and Privacy in Software for Schools* (ST4S) provides risk reports for digital products, now including AI apps ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/06/25/could-ai-bring-about-the-paradigm-shift-we-need-in-our-education-system/#:~:text=It%20is%20worth%20noting%20that,the%20NZ%20Ministry%20of%20Education)).  

**Current News**  
- **Government Initiatives**: In Feb 2025, Education Minister Erica Stanford announced a cross-ministry working group on AI in teaching and learning ([nztech.org.nz](https://nztech.org.nz/2025/02/25/teachers-voice-kicking-off-2025-with-ai-in-education/#:~:text=AI%20Update%20from%20Our%20Minister,So%20watch%20this%20space)). This signals impending strategy development. The NZ government’s AI Forum has also formed an Education subgroup to promote safe, innovative AI use in schools.  
- **NZCER Surveys**: The NZ Council for Educational Research launched nationwide surveys in late 2024 to map teachers’ (and students’) views on generative AI in classrooms ([www.nzcer.org.nz](https://www.nzcer.org.nz/news-and-blogs/nz-primary-school-teachers-years-5-8-share-your-insights-ai-classroom#:~:text=NZCER%20is%20conducting%20online%20surveys,will%20contribute%20to%20this%20research)). Early outreach is seeking broad teacher input on AI use, impact, and ethics.  
- **Industry Voices**: Commentators note NZ is *lagging* behind peers (Australia, Singapore, OECD nations) in formal AI education policy ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=The%20New%20Zealand%20education%20system,a%20mixture%20of%20excitement%20and)). However, local EdTech and advocacy groups are active: e.g., articles by educational leaders emphasize that AI can be used to **tailor learning, automate routine tasks, and support teachers**, while urging robust safeguards ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/01/boosting-new-zealands-education-standards-with-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=,with%20the%20new%20curriculum)) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/01/boosting-new-zealands-education-standards-with-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=For%20teachers%2C%20AI%20can%20provide,quality%20education)). Generative AI’s promise – a “personal tutor” for each student – is a recurring theme.  

**Research Overview**  
- **Academic Research**: NZ educators are studying AI integration. A recent survey of 99 NZ secondary leaders (May 2024) found that AI adoption is still *very slow* and many school leaders were unaware of MOE’s GenAI guidelines ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/06/25/could-ai-bring-about-the-paradigm-shift-we-need-in-our-education-system/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2099%20responses,by%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Education)). This points to a need for dissemination and training. The same study showed strong support among teachers for a national AI framework and more AI literacy training ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/06/25/could-ai-bring-about-the-paradigm-shift-we-need-in-our-education-system/#:~:text=This%20knowledge%20gap%20exposed%20a,for%20EdTech%20to%20collaborate%20with)).  
- **Educational Theory**: Thought leaders distinguish three future “paradigms” of AI in education ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=Paradigm%201%3A%20Personalised%20Learning%20Journeys%3A,could%20be%20a%20valuable%20solution)). In the most student-driven scenario, learners lead personalized paths with AI coaches—potentially easing the burden of one-size-fits-all teaching.  However, experts caution that school must balance these tools with human mentorship and communal learning ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=However%2C%20we%20need%20to%20be,in%20an%20age%20of%20AI)) ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/12/11/integrating-ai-and-academia.html#:~:text=Certainly%2C%20the%20widely%20discussed%20concerns,is%20otherwise%20difficult%20to%20scale)). A University of Auckland report notes AI may become “the most significant democratization of education since the printing press,” but argues *human-led learning communities* will still anchor value ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/12/11/integrating-ai-and-academia.html#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20is%20a%20disruptive,is%20the%20purpose%20of%20the)) ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/12/11/integrating-ai-and-academia.html#:~:text=Certainly%2C%20the%20widely%20discussed%20concerns,is%20otherwise%20difficult%20to%20scale)).  
- **Global Context**: NZ’s research and policy discussions draw on international models. For example, OECD and UNESCO recommend shifting teachers’ roles toward facilitation: AI can handle administrative tasks (grading, scheduling) so teachers focus on high-touch support ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=,This%20shift)). UNESCO frameworks also call for co-design with stakeholders and teachers’ AI-professional development ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=Framework%20for%20Teachers%20by%C2%A0%20UNESCO%2C,to%20suit%20specific%20national%20contexts)) ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=professional%20development%20for%20teachers%20should,join%20here)). Locally, tech alliance blogs highlight these trends and urge embedding AI ethics and digital literacy in teacher training ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=Framework%20for%20Teachers%20by%C2%A0%20UNESCO%2C,to%20suit%20specific%20national%20contexts)) ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/12/11/integrating-ai-and-academia.html#:~:text=Certainly%2C%20the%20widely%20discussed%20concerns,is%20otherwise%20difficult%20to%20scale)).  

**Case Studies**  
- **Auckland University – “Sofia” AI Tutor**: The University of Auckland trialled “Sofia,” an anthropomorphic AI agent for marketing students ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=Sofia%20is%20an%20anthropomorphic%20AI,been%20mentioned%20in%20The%20Conversation)). Sofia answers course questions, gives quizzes, and even holds simple “discussions.”  It provides teachers with analytics on student use, helping identify learning gaps. (The Sofia team won regional AI awards and published research on their work ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=Sofia%20is%20an%20anthropomorphic%20AI,been%20mentioned%20in%20The%20Conversation)).)  
- **Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology – Cogniti AI Agents**: Toi Ohomai has used the Cogniti AI platform to build multiple course-specific agents ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=Toi%20Ohomai%20Institute%20of%20Technology,may%20not%20be%20limited%20to)). For example, one agent quizzes beauty therapy students for revision, another acts as a nursing mentor, and a third simulates law scenarios with a virtual legal advisor. Teachers at Toi Ohomai have documented their evaluation of these agents, showing how automated feedback was integrated into actual teaching ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=,both%20in%20paper%20and%20video)).  
- **AUT (Auckland University of Tech) – Research Proposal Assistant**: AUT created a Cogniti-based agent to assist Master’s students in drafting research proposals ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=Auckland%20University%20of%20Technology%20has,with%20feedback%20and%20possible%20edits)). The agent aggregates example abstracts from previous theses, gives feedback on student drafts, and suggests edits. Though not a formal assessment tool, this prototype “review-and-feedback” AI reflects how writing assistance can be embedded in tertiary learning ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=Auckland%20University%20of%20Technology%20has,with%20feedback%20and%20possible%20edits)).  
- **Māori Language AI (Kahu.code etc.)**: Aotearoa has unique AI initiatives for indigenous language. Projects like *Kahu.code* develop bilingual AI text and voice models focused on “reo hangarau” (Māori tech terminology) ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=,code)). These tools aim to support technical education in te reo Māori and make AI interfaces accessible for Māori learners.  
- **Vocational Oral Exams (FFCoVE)**: The Food & Fibre Centre of Vocational Excellence is funding Scarlatti Research to build an AI oral-assessment agent ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=The%20Food%20and%20Fibre%20Centre,based%29%2C%20and%20grades%20their%20responses)). This voice-based system will generate questions and converse with learners, automatically grading oral responses. The goal is to offer an alternative to resource-intensive live interviews, giving rural and vocational students more practice and teachers more time for instruction ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=The%20Food%20and%20Fibre%20Centre,based%29%2C%20and%20grades%20their%20responses)).  
- **NZQA AI Chatbot**: The NZ Qualifications Authority is enhancing its student helpline with generative AI ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=Country%3A%20New%20Zealand)). Its current chatbot fielding calls will be upgraded to AI—enabling more conversational support. This demonstrates NZ government agencies *slowly piloting* AI where it directly benefits learners.  

**Trends and Predictions**  
- **Personalized Learning & Teacher Facilitation**: As generative AI tools mature, we expect NZ classrooms to offer more tailored learning paths. AI-driven “digital tutors” could adjust content to each student’s pace ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=Paradigm%201%3A%20Personalised%20Learning%20Journeys%3A,could%20be%20a%20valuable%20solution)). In this vision, teachers evolve into coaches/mentors. Industry analysts predict AI will increasingly *handle grading and lesson prep*, allowing educators to focus on mentoring and complex problem-solving ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=,This%20shift)). WK text encourage mindful adoption to avoid a one-size-fits-all “robot-led” approach ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=Paradigm%201%3A%20Personalised%20Learning%20Journeys%3A,could%20be%20a%20valuable%20solution)) ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=However%2C%20we%20need%20to%20be,in%20an%20age%20of%20AI)).  
- **Professional Development Surge**: Widespread training is needed. Many experts call for systemic teacher upskilling in AI literacy ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=,designers%20in%20the%20research%20and)) ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/06/25/could-ai-bring-about-the-paradigm-shift-we-need-in-our-education-system/#:~:text=This%20knowledge%20gap%20exposed%20a,for%20EdTech%20to%20collaborate%20with)). NZ initiatives (e.g. AI Master Trainer courses) are already underway, and more programming in teacher colleges is likely. A *community of practice* for AI in education is forming, as UNESCO advises, to share experiences and best practices ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=Framework%20for%20Teachers%20by%C2%A0%20UNESCO%2C,to%20suit%20specific%20national%20contexts)) ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/12/11/integrating-ai-and-academia.html#:~:text=Certainly%2C%20the%20widely%20discussed%20concerns,is%20otherwise%20difficult%20to%20scale)).  
- **Policy and Framework Evolution**: We anticipate new national policies in the next few years. A 2024 education strategy review and AI working group suggest forthcoming guidelines on AI ethics, equity, and data use. Given calls for leadership, NZ may adopt comprehensive AI curricula or standards (similar to tech-rich nations) to avoid falling further behind ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=The%20New%20Zealand%20education%20system,a%20mixture%20of%20excitement%20and)) ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/06/25/could-ai-bring-about-the-paradigm-shift-we-need-in-our-education-system/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2099%20responses,by%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Education)).  
- **Equity and Inclusion Focus**: New Zealand emphasizes inclusive education. Analysts note that AI must not widen disparities. Voices in NZ stress subsidizing AI tools for disadvantaged schools and adapting technology to Māori and Pasifika contexts ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/01/boosting-new-zealands-education-standards-with-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=)) ([scarlatti.co.nz](https://scarlatti.co.nz/case-studies/shaping-the-future-ai-education-projects-in-oceania/#:~:text=,code)). AI’s potential to level achievement gaps – by providing extra support to struggling learners – will be a key measure of success ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/01/boosting-new-zealands-education-standards-with-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=)). Ongoing research is likely to track the digital divide in AI access.  
- **Evolving Assessments**: From the examples above, we predict broader use of AI for assessment and feedback (21st-century testing). Automated writing evaluation, oral proficiency bots, and skill simulators may complement traditional exams. However, academic integrity systems (e.g. NZQA’s detection tools) will also evolve to distinguish student work from AI-generated content.  
- **Global Alignment**: NZ’s AI-in-education will reflect global trends. International partnerships (e.g. OpenAI’s educational programs) and forums (like UNESCO’s education forums) will continue informing NZ strategy. Stakeholders anticipate more “EdTech” partnerships, pilot programs, and evidence-based evaluations to guide scale-up of promising AI tools.  

**Conclusion**  
AI adoption in NZ education is at an inflection point. **Current state**: usage in schools is nascent and uneven – students have easy access to tools like ChatGPT, while teachers are still exploring pedagogical uses ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Early%20news%20stories%20on%20AI,find%20its%20place%20in%20education)) ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/06/25/could-ai-bring-about-the-paradigm-shift-we-need-in-our-education-system/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2099%20responses,by%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Education)).  Official guidance and pilot projects indicate strong institutional interest: the MoE and NZQA have adjusted policies, while universities and vocational providers are experimenting with AI tutors and chatbots. 

**Key insights**: 
- **Promise**: AI can personalize learning, help under-resourced learners, and reduce teacher workload (e.g. by automating admin tasks) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/01/boosting-new-zealands-education-standards-with-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=With%20the%20new%20curriculum%20emphasising,strengths%2C%20and%20areas%20requiring%20improvement)) ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=,This%20shift)). It aligns with NZ’s new curriculum focus on differentiated and data-driven teaching. If implemented thoughtfully, AI could *lift achievement* and support NZ’s competitiveness. 
- **Challenges**: Without clear leadership, uptake remains slow ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=The%20New%20Zealand%20education%20system,a%20mixture%20of%20excitement%20and)) ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/06/25/could-ai-bring-about-the-paradigm-shift-we-need-in-our-education-system/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2099%20responses,by%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Education)). There are concerns about integrity, bias, and the digital divide. Ensuring all schools have infrastructure, training, and culturally-relevant AI tools is critical. NZ must invest in teacher PD, carve out Māori-led AI content, and continuously update policies as the technology evolves ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/12/11/integrating-ai-and-academia.html#:~:text=Certainly%2C%20the%20widely%20discussed%20concerns,is%20otherwise%20difficult%20to%20scale)) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/01/boosting-new-zealands-education-standards-with-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=)). 
- **Next steps**: Stakeholders should collaborate on a strategic roadmap. This “living whitepaper” encourages ongoing dialogue: share case study outcomes, incorporate feedback from educators, and monitor global developments. Consistent with recommendations from leaders like Jacinda Ardern – to frame AI as an _opportunity_ and accompany it with education and support ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/former-new-zealand-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-says-we-should-reframe-how-we-think-about-ai#:~:text=Ardern%20shared%20her%20insights%20on,and%20proactive%20adaptation%20supported%20by)) – New Zealand’s education sector can adapt proactively. 

In summary, AI in New Zealand education is an emerging journey. Early initiatives and research suggest cautious optimism. The coming years will test how well NZ balances innovation with equity and ethics. This report will be updated as the landscape evolves, aiming to equip education leaders with up-to-date insights for strategic decision-making.
