# Generative AI in Education in Aotearoa New Zealand (June 2025 Update)

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) continues to reshape education across Aotearoa New Zealand, from schools to tertiary and professional learning contexts. Rapidly evolving programmes, policy guidance, and classroom innovation are opening up opportunities and raising important questions for all kaimahi, ākonga, and policymakers. This update summarises the latest research, initiatives, and practical developments in Aotearoa’s education sector as of mid-2025.

## New GenAI Education Programmes

**1. Micro-Credentials and Professional Development**

- **Open Polytechnic** has launched an _Introduction to Generative AI_ micro-credential in collaboration with Spark. This accessible, online programme explores practical applications, ethical issues, and the implications of Māori data sovereignty. It offers a foundation for educators and professionals from all sectors to confidently understand and use GenAI tools ([Open Polytechnic, 2024](https://www.openpolytechnic.ac.nz/about-us/news-publications-and-research/news/open-polytechnic-launches-new-introduction-to-generative-ai-micro-credential/)).

- **University of Canterbury** now offers a _Generative AI Bootcamp_ for professionals and educators, featuring prompt engineering, workflow automation, and GenAI integration for day-to-day educational practice ([University of Canterbury, 2024](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/other-study-options/executive-education/short-executive-education-courses/generative-ai-bootcamp---oct-2024)).

- **NZSE College** introduced a five-day bootcamp, _Unlock the Power of Generative AI_, in early 2025. Targeting students, educators, and entrepreneurs, the programme combines hands-on projects, industry engagement, and a final hackathon ([NZSE College, 2025](https://nzse.ac.nz/event/unlock-the-power-of-generative-ai-in-five-days/)).

## Policy, Guidelines, and Ethics

- **Royal Society Te Apārangi** released national _Guidelines for the Use of GenAI in Research in Aotearoa New Zealand_, emphasising human oversight, respect for mana whakahaere (sovereignty) and ethical, context-aware deployment ([Royal Society Te Apārangi, 2024](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/news/guidelines-for-use-of-genai-in-research-in-aotearoa-new-zealand-published/)).

- The **Ministry of Education** has published guidance for using GenAI in NCEA assessment. The focus is on responsible tool use, ensuring authenticity of student work, and balancing innovation with academic integrity ([Ministry of Education, 2025](https://ncea.education.govt.nz/generative-ai-ncea-assessment)).

- The **New Zealand Initiative** report, _Welcome to the Machine: Opportunities and Risks of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Education_, outlines GenAI’s potential for personalised learning and teacher workload reduction, but highlights challenges around bias, misuse, and equity. A pragmatic, science-led classroom approach is recommended ([NZ Initiative, 2024](https://www.nzinitiative.org.nz/reports-and-media/reports/welcome-to-the-machine/)).

- **AI Forum New Zealand** has advocated for early, balanced adoption of GenAI in schools, with Education Lead Dr. Geri Harris highlighting opportunities for digital equity and upskilling, but cautioning about oversight and inclusivity ([1News, 2025](https://www.1news.co.nz/2025/02/11/ai-in-schools-something-we-can-embrace/)).

## Professional Events and Collaboration

- **AI in Education: StrAIght to the Future** (EDconnect, Jan 2026) will provide hands-on workshops, panels, and networking focused on meaningful and culturally-informed classroom uses for GenAI. International expert Holly Clark headlines the event ([AI in Education NZ, 2025](https://aiineducation.nz/)).

- The **2025 AI in Higher Education Symposium** brought together New Zealand and Australian tertiary leaders to share case studies and effective GenAI teaching and assessment practices ([University of Auckland, 2025](https://teachwell.auckland.ac.nz/calendar_event/2025-ai-in-higher-education-symposium-australia-new-zealand/)).

## Classroom and Curriculum Integration

- **Auckland University of Technology (AUT)** developed a “braided river” framework for assessment redesign, mapping GenAI’s role at each stage—ideation, research, engagement, and analysis—while embedding critical, culturally responsive practice ([AUT, 2025](https://www.aut.ac.nz/about/teaching-learning-and-assessment/generative-ai-and-assessment-at-aut/what-it-means-to-redesign-assessments-with-generative-ai)).

- **Greater Christchurch Schools Network (GCSN)** is piloting digital literacy resources to help ākonga and kaiako navigate GenAI’s risks and benefits, featuring lesson activities, policy templates, and guidelines for safe classroom use ([Virtual School Meanderings, 2025](https://virtualschooling.wordpress.com/2025/03/13/new-resources-and-learning-opportunities/)).

## Conclusion

Aotearoa New Zealand’s education sector is proactively embracing GenAI through training programmes, robust ethical guidance, collaborative professional events, and practical classroom resources. These initiatives reflect a commitment to upskilling teachers and ākonga, promoting responsible and culturally conscious usage, and upholding the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori data sovereignty. As GenAI capabilities expand, sustained research, dialogue, and responsive professional learning will be vital for ensuring these technologies enhance education in meaningful, local ways.
