# AI in Education in Aotearoa New Zealand

Artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI tools like ChatGPT, has rapidly become a part of daily life and is reshaping education. In 2025 UNESCO even themed its International Day of Education around AI, underscoring its global impact ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=AI%20is%20making%20a%20significant,gain%20traction%20in%20early%202023)). New Zealand’s young learners, often very tech-fluent, were among the first to adopt these tools when they gained prominence in 2023 ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=AI%20is%20making%20a%20significant,gain%20traction%20in%20early%202023)). Early coverage of AI in NZ schools focused on misuse – for example, students using AI to write essays – but educators now recognize that AI must find a positive place in learning rather than be universally banned ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Early%20news%20stories%20on%20AI,find%20its%20place%20in%20education)).

However, AI’s rapid uptake has outpaced policy. The Ministry of Education (MoE) and New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) issued initial guidance to schools in 2023, but schools are still developing their own AI policies ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20central%20concerns,own%20policies%20around%20the%20technology)). Official advice emphasizes a **“practical, educative approach to AI”**. The MoE recommends that schools _discuss_ with staff how AI is used in each context and then formalize policies. These policies should cover the **purpose and scope** of AI in the school, explicitly state principles and guidelines for internal and external use, include **risk mitigation** strategies, mandate **professional development for teachers**, address **data privacy**, and schedule regular review ([www.education.govt.nz](https://www.education.govt.nz/education-professionals/schools-year-0-13/digital-technology/generative-ai#:~:text=Discuss%20with%20your%20staff%20how,to%20AI%20and%20its%20uses)). For example, a Ministry template suggests bullet-point lists in policy, including items like “purpose and scope of AI”, “risk mitigation”, and “data privacy” ([www.education.govt.nz](https://www.education.govt.nz/education-professionals/schools-year-0-13/digital-technology/generative-ai#:~:text=Consider%20structuring%20your%20school%20AI,policy%20to%20include%20guidance%20on)). Schools are also urged to clarify how the use of AI must be acknowledged in student work – treating AI as a source or tool that should be cited if used ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=AI%20policies%20should%20include%20guidance,acknowledged%20in%20referencing%20if%20used)).

Part of this guidance is specific to assessment. Schools that offer NCEA-listed standards must have an **authenticity policy** that explicitly addresses AI. NZQA states that academic integrity policies “must include the acceptable use of GenAI.” To discourage cheating and preserve integrity, NZQA recommends structuring assessments with frequent check-points: regular milestones, check-ins, required references, follow-up questions, and supervised conditions. Teachers are advised to look out for telltale signs of AI writing (e.g. inconsistent tone or American spelling) and to use AI-detection tools cautiously (aware of false positives) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=%2A%20Regular%20milestones%20and%20check,of%20questions%20to%20discourage%20AI)) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=,using%20authenticity%20declarations%20for%20%C4%81konga)). Notably, while some AI may be allowed in internal assessments, NZQA **forbids any generative AI use in external exams** – candidates cannot submit AI-generated content for marking ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=While%20there%20may%20be%20scope,of%20the%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20marked%20work)).

The MoE has committed to **updating its guidance** on AI and NCEA authenticity, and it is revamping the technology curriculum. From 2027, the refreshed _Technology Learning Area_ will include AI topics – teaching its origins (_whakapapa_), potential biases, benefits, risks and ethical issues ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Another%20way%20to%20empower%20appropriate,will%20be%20compulsory%20by%202027)). Additional research is underway on how AI affects primary education, to inform future guidelines and resources for younger learners ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Research%20is%20ongoing%20about%20AI,and%20resources%20for%20primary%20schools)).

Despite this flurry of policy development, on-the-ground practices in 2024–25 show both widespread use and varied readiness. AI-powered features are now ubiquitous – appearing in tools teachers use every day (from design platforms like Canva to quiz apps like Kahoot) – and both students and teachers are “already utilising available AI tools” in New Zealand schools ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=While%20schools%20are%20fine,in%20a%20variety%20of%20ways)). Surveys indicate heavy use of AI by young people: one 2024 Australian survey found 60% of students claiming to use AI for schoolwork, and Kiwi usage is thought to be similarly high ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=In%20a%20self,misusing%20the%20technology%20for%20assignments)). Anecdotally, one Auckland English teacher reported **one in five students** misusing AI (e.g. generating essays) for assignments ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=In%20a%20self,misusing%20the%20technology%20for%20assignments)). However, there are also positive engagements: students sometimes use AI as a study aid to _reword complex ideas_ or gather research resources ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=But%20teachers%20also%20report%20more,or%20gather%20resources%20for%20use)). Teachers themselves report using AI for tasks like lesson planning, resource generation and administration. Pauline Cleaver of the MoE notes “small ad hoc research projects indicate that growing numbers of teachers are using AI for such things as lesson planning, resource generation, and administrative tasks,” although some lag behind due to knowledge gaps ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Teachers%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20also%20self,AI%20across%20many%20tasks)). In multiple workshops early 2025, NZ educators expressed “energy and eagerness” at exploring AI tools to support their classrooms ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2025/02/24/teachers-voice-kicking-off-2025-with-ai-in-education/#:~:text=I%20was%20thrilled%20to%20join,centric%20and%20pedagogical%20approach)).

**Equity and cultural considerations** are central in Aotearoa. The MoE explicitly warns that AI can reproduce biases: it cautions teachers that large language models (LLMs) are only “weak on Mātauranga and Te Reo Māori” and may produce results that entrench inequities ([www.rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/491085/chatgpt-might-doom-us-all-but-it-won-t-replace-teachers-expert#:~:text=The%20Ministry%20of%20Education%20here,which%20can%20reinforce%20existing%20inequities)). In other words, AI trained largely on global datasets may neglect New Zealand’s bicultural curriculum and context. This risk is taken seriously: for example, a Northland iwi collective developed a decades-long te reo Māori audio archive to build a world-leading speech-recognition model. Experts emphasize maintaining **Māori data sovereignty** in such projects. NVIDIA reports that Te Hiku Media has used AI _ethically_ to create an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for te reo that achieves ~92% accuracy ([blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/te-hiku-media-maori-speech-ai/?ncid=so-twit-357206#:~:text=Using%20ethical%2C%20transparent%20methods%20of,which%20is%20a%20Polynesian%20language)). Yet legal protections lag: journalists note that under current NZ law, this cultural taonga (the Māori language audio dataset) lacks special protection, prompting warnings that AI could be “one of the next catastrophes” for Māori unless the government intervenes ([newsroom.co.nz](https://newsroom.co.nz/2024/09/12/new-zealand-law-not-prepared-to-protect-world-leading-te-reo-maori-ai-database/#:~:text=But%20as%20the%20lucrative%20transcription,M%C4%81ori%20data%20by%20international%20companies)). These concerns coincide with a government push to grow AI nationally: Science Minister Judith Collins has said AI should drive economic growth (projected to add NZD $76 billion by 2038) ([newsroom.co.nz](https://newsroom.co.nz/2024/09/12/new-zealand-law-not-prepared-to-protect-world-leading-te-reo-maori-ai-database/#:~:text=At%20the%20same%20time%2C%20the,Zealand%E2%80%99s%20annual%20GDP%20by%202038)). Māori leaders urge that, as NZ accelerates AI in education and industry, strong safeguards and culturally responsive frameworks must be in place.

On a practical level, schools are encouraged to foster **digital literacy** so all students can engage safely with AI. Official guidance tells teachers to always _check AI outputs_, avoid feeding personal data into generative tools, watch out for cultural bias, and read the terms of service of any AI software ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/#:~:text=,reading%20terms%20and%20conditions)). Training educators is key: every AI policy template stresses professional development. For instance, one education leader has created a free “AI Policy for Schools” template to help schools get started, and EDConnect’s AI conferences in 2025 reached 900+ teachers aiming to build “robust foundations for AI-augmented education” ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2025/02/24/teachers-voice-kicking-off-2025-with-ai-in-education/#:~:text=IRCAI%20Fellow,is%20all%20about%20creating%20engaging)) ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2025/02/24/teachers-voice-kicking-off-2025-with-ai-in-education/#:~:text=Remember%20to%20join%20the%20AI,Please%20register%20your%20interest%20here)). The Education Minister announced a new **cross-ministerial working group** on AI in teaching and learning ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2025/02/24/teachers-voice-kicking-off-2025-with-ai-in-education/#:~:text=AI%20Update%20from%20Our%20Minister,So%20watch%20this%20space)), and the AI Forum has formed an Education workstream to foster collaboration among schools, industry and policymakers ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2025/02/24/teachers-voice-kicking-off-2025-with-ai-in-education/#:~:text=AI%20Forum%E2%80%99s%20Commitment%20to%20Empowering,AI%E2%80%99s%20benefits%20reach%20all%20learners)). Such efforts aim to ensure that AI’s benefits – from automating routine tasks to enabling personalized learning – reach all learners, not just the tech-savvy. New Zealand educators are looking to move the conversation beyond fears of cheating. As one NZ teacher observes, much public discourse has focused on academic integrity, but we should “stop looking for evidence of cheating and start looking for evidence of learning” ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/10/23/teacher-voice-ai-in-education-in-aotearoa-reflections-and-research-insights/#:~:text=A%20recent%20RNZ%20article%20highlighted,that%20augments%20the%20learning%20journey)). In this view, AI becomes a partner in education: it could **remove teachers’ administrative burdens and provide real-time feedback**, freeing teachers to mentor and engage more deeply ([futurelearning.nz](https://futurelearning.nz/p/charting-the-future-of-education#:~:text=,128)) ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/10/28/how-and-why-we-should-work-with-chatgbt-in-our-schools-.html#:~:text=Opinion%3A%20Teachers%20should%20use%20ChatGPT,necessarily%20objective%2C%20says%20Jack%20Webster)). (For example, Australian ministers now support national guidelines encouraging schools to integrate AI tools into practice ([www.auckland.ac.nz](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/10/28/how-and-why-we-should-work-with-chatgbt-in-our-schools-.html#:~:text=But%20evidently%20schools%20and%20education,on%20how%20it%20could%20be)).)

Not all change is seamless. A 2024 survey of NZ educators found that **three-quarters of teachers were unaware** of the MoE’s AI guidelines, highlighting the need for better communication and culturally responsive policies ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/10/23/teacher-voice-ai-in-education-in-aotearoa-reflections-and-research-insights/#:~:text=While%20AIED%20has%20rapidly%20evolved,a%20culturally%20responsive%20national%20framework)). Currently some schools actively ban AI while others experiment freely, creating an “AI divide.” Educators are calling for more equity in training and consistent national direction. Even so, research suggests that ChatGPT hasn’t dramatically increased misconduct: Stanford studies noted that cheating rates among students stayed roughly _stable_ after AI’s arrival ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2024/10/23/teacher-voice-ai-in-education-in-aotearoa-reflections-and-research-insights/#:~:text=Research%20from%20Stanford%20University%2C%E2%80%9CCheating%20in,However%2C%20I%20believe)). This bolsters calls to embrace AI as a learning opportunity.

In summary, New Zealand is working to **integrate AI into education responsibly**. Schools are adopting guidance from the Ministry and NZQA (for instance, explicitly naming AI use in academic integrity policies ([www.education.govt.nz](https://www.education.govt.nz/education-professionals/schools-year-0-13/digital-technology/generative-ai#:~:text=Discuss%20with%20your%20staff%20how,to%20AI%20and%20its%20uses)) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/#:~:text=AI%20policies%20should%20include%20guidance,acknowledged%20in%20referencing%20if%20used))), while curriculum writers prepare mandatory AI topics by 2027 ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Another%20way%20to%20empower%20appropriate,will%20be%20compulsory%20by%202027)). Teacher conferences and online resources are spreading best practices. At the same time, the sector remains cautious: we are consciously addressing issues like bias, data privacy and equity – including ensuring AI content respects te ao Māori and Pacific perspectives ([www.rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/491085/chatgpt-might-doom-us-all-but-it-won-t-replace-teachers-expert#:~:text=The%20Ministry%20of%20Education%20here,which%20can%20reinforce%20existing%20inequities)) ([www.scoop.co.nz](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/ED2501/S00023/2025-international-day-of-education-theme-ai-and-education-preserving-human-agency-in-a-world-of-automation.htm#:~:text=In%20a%20region%20where%20people,preserving%20and%20enhancing%20human%20agency)). The hope is that by coupling innovation with ethical oversight and inclusivity, AI will **transform learning** in Aotearoa for the better.

**Key Takeaways:** New Zealand schools are **rapidly adopting AI tools**, and official guidance recommends embedding AI policies (covering scope, risk mitigation, privacy, and teacher training) in school plans ([www.education.govt.nz](https://www.education.govt.nz/education-professionals/schools-year-0-13/digital-technology/generative-ai#:~:text=Discuss%20with%20your%20staff%20how,to%20AI%20and%20its%20uses)) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Current%20guidance%20from%20the%20Ministry,These%20include)). All NCEA assessment policies must explicitly address AI use to protect academic integrity ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Schools%20who%20assess%20listed%20standards,are%20in%20ensuring%20academic%20integrity)) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=While%20there%20may%20be%20scope,of%20the%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20marked%20work)). The upcoming curriculum will teach AI concepts nationwide by 2027 ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Another%20way%20to%20empower%20appropriate,will%20be%20compulsory%20by%202027)). In practice, students and teachers report using AI for both learning (e.g. concept-rephrasing, personalised content) and teaching tasks (lesson planning, feedback) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=In%20a%20self,misusing%20the%20technology%20for%20assignments)) ([www.schoolnews.co.nz](https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2025/06/ai-and-the-future-of-education/amp/#:~:text=Pauline%20Cleaver%2C%20acting%20haut%C5%AB%20,things%20as%20lesson%20planning%2C%20resource)). NZ authorities stress ethical concerns: AI must not disadvantage ākonga, particularly in te reo Māori or under-resourced communities ([www.rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/491085/chatgpt-might-doom-us-all-but-it-won-t-replace-teachers-expert#:~:text=The%20Ministry%20of%20Education%20here,which%20can%20reinforce%20existing%20inequities)) ([newsroom.co.nz](https://newsroom.co.nz/2024/09/12/new-zealand-law-not-prepared-to-protect-world-leading-te-reo-maori-ai-database/#:~:text=But%20as%20the%20lucrative%20transcription,M%C4%81ori%20data%20by%20international%20companies)). To bridge gaps, New Zealand is forming inter-agency task forces and educator networks (e.g. AI Forum workstreams, teacher-led roadmaps) to ensure AI’s **benefits are reglemented, equitable, and aligned with NZ values** ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2025/02/24/teachers-voice-kicking-off-2025-with-ai-in-education/#:~:text=AI%20Update%20from%20Our%20Minister,So%20watch%20this%20space)) ([edtechnz.org.nz](https://edtechnz.org.nz/2025/02/24/teachers-voice-kicking-off-2025-with-ai-in-education/#:~:text=AI%20Forum%E2%80%99s%20Commitment%20to%20Empowering,AI%E2%80%99s%20benefits%20reach%20all%20learners)).
