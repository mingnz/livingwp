# Generative AI in Education in Aotearoa New Zealand (June 2025)

As of June 2025, Aotearoa New Zealand's education sector is rapidly exploring and adopting generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to enhance teaching, learning, assessment, and research. The following update summarises the latest research, practice, and initiatives relevant to educators, researchers, and policymakers across the motu.

## New GenAI Education Programmes

**Micro-Credentials and Professional Development**

- **Open Polytechnic** has launched a new _Introduction to Generative AI_ micro-credential, in collaboration with Spark. This fully online programme equips learners with key capabilities for GenAI, exploring practical applications, ethical issues, and Māori data sovereignty considerations. Designed for a wide audience, this flexible micro-credential helps educators and professionals across sectors understand and use GenAI tools effectively ([Open Polytechnic, 2024](https://www.openpolytechnic.ac.nz/about-us/news-publications-and-research/news/open-polytechnic-launches-new-introduction-to-generative-ai-micro-credential/)).
- **University of Canterbury** now offers a _Generative AI Bootcamp_ for upskilling professionals, including educators. This intensive short course covers prompt engineering, workflow, and process automation, providing hands-on experience for integrating GenAI into everyday educational practice ([University of Canterbury, 2024](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/other-study-options/executive-education/short-executive-education-courses/generative-ai-bootcamp---oct-2024)).

## Guidelines and Ethics

- **Royal Society Te Apārangi** has issued _Guidelines for the Use of GenAI in Research in Aotearoa New Zealand_. These best practice principles emphasise human oversight, data sovereignty, and ethical deployment—relevant for tertiary educators, researchers, and school innovation leaders ([Royal Society Te Apārangi, 2024](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/news/guidelines-for-use-of-genai-in-research-in-aotearoa-new-zealand-published/)).
- The **New Zealand Initiative** published _Welcome to the Machine: Opportunities and Risks of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Education_. This report outlines potential benefits for personalised learning and workload reduction but also addresses concerns including bias, misuse, and equity. It calls for a science-led, pragmatic approach to classroom integration ([NZ Initiative, 2024](https://www.nzinitiative.org.nz/reports-and-media/reports/welcome-to-the-machine/)).

## Professional Events and Collaboration

- **AI in Education: StrAIght to the Future** (EDconnect, Jan 2026) is set to provide Aotearoa educators with practical workshops, expert panels, and networking on AI's classroom impact. Keynotes include leading voices like Holly Clark, offering insight into hands-on GenAI integration ([AI in Education NZ, 2025](https://aiineducation.nz/)).
- The _2025 AI in Higher Education Symposium_ connects New Zealand and Australian tertiary educators to share case studies and best practices for GenAI adoption in teaching and assessment ([University of Auckland, 2025](https://teachwell.auckland.ac.nz/calendar_event/2025-ai-in-higher-education-symposium-australia-new-zealand/)).

## Integration into Teaching, Learning, and Assessment

- **Auckland University of Technology (AUT)** has developed a "braided river" framework for assessment redesign, explicitly mapping how GenAI can support various assessment stages—such as ideation, research engagement, and analysis. This model promotes critical, nuanced, and culturally responsive GenAI use, encouraging academics to rethink both assessment processes and student learning opportunities ([AUT, 2025](https://www.aut.ac.nz/about/teaching-learning-and-assessment/generative-ai-and-assessment-at-aut/what-it-means-to-redesign-assessments-with-generative-ai)).

## Conclusion

New Zealand's education sector is embracing generative AI through practical training, robust ethical guidance, collaborative events, and classroom innovation. These proactive efforts aim to upskill teachers and learners, foster responsible use, and ensure that local contexts, including the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori data sovereignty, are prioritised. Continuous research, dialogue, and professional learning will be key as GenAI evolves within Aotearoa’s schools and tertiary institutions.
